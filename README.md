Trillo is a beautifully designed and fully responsive web application for a fictional travel booking service. The project serves as an excellent demonstration of modern CSS and HTML techniques, with a strong focus on Flexbox for layout design. Inspired by Jonas Schmedtmann's work, Trillo is a showcase of how advanced web design principles can be applied to create an intuitive and visually appealing user experience.
